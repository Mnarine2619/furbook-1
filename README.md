## Furbook
Welcome to Furbook! I would like to say this is the first pet-social-media website, but there are plenty already out there.
With that said, this website is for demonstration purposes and should not be used for actual pet-social-media networking.

If you are using this for the NYC React Series, clone this repository before the lesson and preview the website for your students. Have them make predictions about the code that was involved in the development of this website.

Happy teaching!

## Getting Started in CS50
